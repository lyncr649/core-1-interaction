			since wednesday I've had Hot Knife stuck in my head

		I left at about 7:30 to walk over to a friends house, when I had almost arrived at the apartment, 
		she called saying she couldnt hang out anymore so I had to turn around and head back to my apartment. 
		Started at 7:30, arrived at my final destination at 8:30. From my apartment to Washington Square park and back. 


		Red on my walk home:
